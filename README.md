# 👋 Hi, I'm Bri — Welcome to My Python Coding Journey

This is where I'm documenting my first steps into mastering coding with Python.  
Even if I don't know much yet — I'm learning fast, and I'm excited to grow.

## What's in this repo?
- 📝 Notes from my python learning path
- 🧪 Small python experiments and projects
- 🐧 Python tips/commands/progress

## First Project: Hello using Python
A simple Python script that says "Hello" — because every expert starts somewhere.
